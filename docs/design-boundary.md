# Design boundary

## Story 126 security ownership

The module enforces the AKS-side production controls: private API, Azure RBAC, disabled local accounts, mandatory administrator-group retention, KMS configuration, and diagnostic routing. Key Vault/key lifecycle and RBAC, private DNS, Log Analytics and SIEM operations, archive retention, Conditional Access, PIM, and operational approval remain externally owned.

SSH service disabling is an AKS preview capability not represented by the locked AzureRM 4.81.0 schema. It remains an explicit external readiness item and must be verified after deployment if approved for Azure Government.


## Owned by this module

- Optional AKS resource group, AKS cluster, fixed system pool, and manual-mode user pools
- User-assigned control-plane and kubelet identities and required role assignments
- Entra/Azure RBAC, disabled local accounts, OIDC, and Workload Identity
- Azure CNI Overlay and Cilium
- AKS-native add-ons, maintenance, upgrades, and approved diagnostics
- `cluster_profile`, compliance, autoscaling, disruption, backup, and PKI contracts

## Integrated, not created

- Existing subnet, routing/NAT/firewall, and private DNS zone
- Existing ACR (`AcrPull` assignment only)
- Existing Log Analytics and Defender workspaces
- Enterprise PKI metadata; no issuer, certificates, or trust bundle is installed
- Backup metadata consumed by a separate backup module

## Outside this module

Fleet Manager, AKS Backup resources, GitOps controllers, Karpenter `NodePool`/`AKSNodeClass`, Kyverno/Gatekeeper, PSA namespace labels, default-deny policies, StorageClasses, snapshots, PDBs, topology-spread rules, applications, and multi-cloud/CAPI management-plane components.

## Profile enforcement boundary

Stateful mode requires Azure Disk CSI, the snapshot controller, enabled backup handoff, conservative consolidation, a multi-zone fixed pool, and no Terraform-managed Spot pools. Runtime policies such as PDBs and topology spread cannot be truthfully enforced by an infrastructure-only AKS resource module; they are explicit bootstrap/application obligations.

Stateless mode permits NAP, Spot, Ephemeral OS disks, scale-to-zero, and aggressive consolidation. Exact NAP policy remains in GitOps so cluster infrastructure and workload scheduling ownership do not overlap.
